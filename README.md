## Hi there 👋

I’m Jay.

I work with electronics, firmware, and hardware systems, with a strong pull toward art and nature.

My first contact with electronics came through my father in the 1980s. As a kid, somewhere in my early teens, I etched my first PCB at home and learned soldering and how to interpret schematics. One original board from that time still exists, kept safe all these years by my father, which says more than I ever could.

Electronics, coding, nature, and making things are the threads that keep intersecting throughout my life.

At the end of 2025, I created **Currenari Lab** as a home for my electronics work. It’s where hardware builds, experiments, and long-form technical documentation come together once they reach a stable, working state.

Alongside this, I run a separate project focused entirely on field recording and quiet outdoor sound. It lives apart from the electronics work and stays that way by design.

### The things I care about

- not all ideas are meant to become products, some are paths  
- open source and open hardware  
- documentation as a tool for understanding  
- nature as a place where my AuDHD mind can ground and reset  
- cats, dogs, and art  

I also write technical documentation and books based on my builds. My first technical book was published at the age of 54.

Links and projects appear here once they’re ready to stand on their own.

Thanks for stopping by.
