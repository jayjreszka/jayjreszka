## Hi there 👋

I'm Jay. I work with open hardware electronics, firmware, and embedded systems—with a strong pull toward art and nature.

My first contact with electronics came through my father in the 1980s. As a teenager, I etched my first PCB at home. One original board from that time still exists, kept safe by my father ever since.

At the end of 2025, I created **Currenari Lab** as a home for my electronics work—open hardware builds, experiments, and technical documentation. I also run a separate project focused on field recording and quiet outdoor sound.

### What I care about
- open source and open hardware
- documentation as a tool for understanding
- nature as a place where my AuDHD mind can ground and reset
- ideas as paths, exploration, and learning

I write technical documentation and books based on real builds. My first technical book was published at 54.
